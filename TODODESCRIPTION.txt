Todo App
Date/ Day- theses appear in the top left and top right of the program.
Whether they are needed is a question to be asked but the information 
we need for this is of course the date and time and some form of being able 
to get this information.

Progress Bar- This Bar shows how far we are in completing the day’s todo’s. for this to function it
needs to know how many todo there are so it knows how much the bars needs to be emptied and when they are completed 
to fill it back up again (this would be filled the user clicks on 
the Tick to complete it or the cross to delete the todo)

Input Box- Input box where the user can add a new todo and by using the button it can confirm this and add the todo 
to the list of todos *This would alter the Progress bar*.
Buttons on each Todo
Delete- Deletes the selected Todo not to be returned to
Pause- Pauses the selected Todo and adds it to a “Do later” pile (questionable feature)
Tick- This registers the Todo as compete and fills the Progress bar accordingly.


Suggestions for Improvement

Removal of the Pause Feature- This get rid of the Pause feature as 
it has little impact on the program. 
If someone wants to do their task later they just leave it in the main list. 
Adding it to another list seems unnecessary.


Saving Deleted Todo- Have a possible Backup for the Todo that have been deleted
as it may have been a mistake to delete it.

Extra Info in Todos- Have the option to Add time Deadlines to your Todo or allow them to carry on to the next day
Save, Previous days todo’s- the previous Day’s todos are remember and 
you can go back to them all the way upto a month then they are deleted.  

Done Notification- A idea to help the progress bar. When you complete a Todo instead of it disappearing
 of your screen it puts line through It and into a new section at the top called completed. Adds a sense of achievement. 
This could be recycled code from the old “add later” feature.
